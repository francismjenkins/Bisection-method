# Bisection-method
Find the maximum of a polynomial function using the bisection method

To find the maximum or extrema of a function, we can set its first derivative to zero and solve for x.
The bisection method is a technique used to find the critical numbers of a function using an iterative approach.
First, we can pick an interval (either arbitrily or by graphing the function). Then we compute the midpoint of the
interval, and with each iteration, we continually narrow the interval until we find a value within a predefined 
tolerance. In essence, when we use bisection to find the maxima, we simply find critical values for the first
derivative of our function (rather than the function itself). 

The code was written in both Matlab and Perl.
